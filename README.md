## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Different keys on your computer keyboard have a corresponding number, or JavaScript event keycodes. For example a = 65, f = 70, etc. Some keys don't have codes. The idea is, when a user presses a key on her keyboard, we can use the number associated with that key to play an audio element that also matches that number with a data attribute (data-key). Try it! Make funny tunes and enjoy!
