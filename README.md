## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

To build the card game, I started off with an HTML container and within that HTML container, I added the cards. Next, I applied a few styles on the cards and modified properties such as width, height, color, etc. There were a couple of functions that also had to be established. For example, the random shuffle algorithm was a simple but fun aspect of this game. The algorithm involves a variable that loops through the length of an array and generates a random number to shuffle the cards. Another important function was to check if the cards matched. I did this by using the data-* attribute to verify if the value of an HTML element or card, was equal to the value of another card.
